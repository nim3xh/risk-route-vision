# Trained Model Files

**Important:** Place your trained model files here before running the backend.

## Required Files:

1. **xgb_vehicle_specific_risk.pkl** (Generated from training notebook)
2. **vehicle_thresholds.csv** (Generated from training notebook)

## How to Get These Files:

1. Run the `XG_BOOST_NEWER.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Download the generated files from:
   - `/content/models/xgb_vehicle_specific_risk.pkl`
   - `/content/outputs/vehicle_thresholds.csv`
3. Place them in this directory

## File Structure:

```
models/
├── README.md (this file)
├── xgb_vehicle_specific_risk.pkl (you need to add this)
└── vehicle_thresholds.csv (you need to add this)
```

## Without Model Files:

The backend will still work but will use dummy predictions instead of the trained XGBoost model.
You'll see this warning in the console:
```
[Warn] Model file not found, using dummy predictions
```

## See Full Documentation:

Read `back-end/models/README.md` for complete instructions on:
- Training the model
- Model features and performance
- Testing and troubleshooting
- Updating the model
